# Pre commit hook for replacing old classNames with new classNames

## Husky

Husky is a tool that makes it easy to manage Git hooks in a project. Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and merge. Husky allows defining these hooks in the project's package.json file or in a separate configuration file.

## lint-staged

lint-staged is a tool that runs linters (or other scripts) on staged files in Git. This means only the files that are going to be committed are linted, improving performance and ensuring only relevant files are checked.
